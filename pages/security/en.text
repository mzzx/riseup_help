h1. Why security matters

The increasing importance of information and communication has brought with it another phenomenon: the rise of a *surveillance society*. You can think of surveillance as an attempt by the powerful to [_maintain their dominance by asserting control over communication_].

*Nation states* have responded to new communications technology by pursuing an infrastructure that facilitates mass surveillance and can easily be re-purposed for total social control. Many governments also contract with unethical private corporations to track activists and break into their devices.

*Corporations* have discovered that the gathering and analysis of massive amounts of personal data is necessary if they want to remain competitive in an information-rich world. In particular, nearly all advertising is shifting toward surveillance-based tracking of our personal behavior.

*Criminals* have discovered that it is very lucrative to attack personal devices and cloud accounts to ransom data or blackmail the user.

In this context, digital security has become vitally important.

* State surveillance has a long history of resulting in the repression of social movements.
* Even indirectly, rampant surveillance has a chilling effect on social movements.
* Corporate surveillance is just as serious as state surveillance. Not only can the massive amounts of data kept on internet users be easily re-purposed for direct state repression, but corporations are now on the verge of obtaining unprecedented power over consumers.

When people start to learn about the rise in surveillance they start to feel overwhelmed. Some decide that it is impossible to be secure, so they resign themselves to live under perpetual surveillance or to forsake all forms of digital communication. At Riseup, we believe there is a third way: our goal is to make a high degree of security easy and accessible for everyone.
