Alias
-----

Do you ever need to give out an email address but don't want to use your normal riseup address? Maybe you want an address for a particular event, or you don't want the recipient to know your actual address. Or maybe you have multiple secret identities because you are a super activist!

Aliases are just the thing you need. You can create new ones in a few clicks and emails sent to that address will arrive in your account. And if you no longer want to receive mails sent to that address, you can delete the alias.

Free Ola Bini
-------------

Ola Bini is a programmer living in Ecuador who works in social justice movements. Ola has worked on free software and cryptographic tools that Riseup and our allies use to protect your digital life online and make the world a better place.

In April 2019, Ola was arrested and detained for 2 months in Equador for alleged links to Julian Assange and WikiLeaks. Riseup and many of our friends online have backed the campaign to support his release and you should too!

People shouldn't imprisoned for fighting and programming for a better world. If you can, try to learn more about Ola Bini's case and the ongoing fundraising to pay for his legal defense.
