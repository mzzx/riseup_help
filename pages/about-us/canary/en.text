h4. _*noun*_

h4. _*1...*_ A small songbird in the finch family, _serinus canaria domestica,_ originally native to islands in the North Atlantic.

h4. _*2...*_ A mechanism to test for unsafe conditions, originating from the use of canaries in coal mines to detect poisonous gases or cave-ins. If the canary died, it was time to get out of the mine. More recently, the term has been used by some online service providers to refer to an affirmative statement, updated regularly, that the provider has not been subjected to certain legal processes. If the statement is not updated in a timely fashion, users may infer that the canary statement may no longer be true.
