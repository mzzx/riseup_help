* Encrypt your mail! For enhanced [[message security => message-security]] use [[openpgp]].
* There are many vulnerabilities with how [[secure connections->network-security]] work. If you need high security, you should always connect to Riseup services using the [[Riseup VPN => vpn]]. This will prevent a long list of potential attacks against your communication.
* To enhance connection security you can use [[Tor]] to connect to [[Riseup's .onion services -> tor#riseups-tor-onion-services]] for IMAP and SMTP. Look for the onion address for mail.riseup.net and smtp.riseup.net addresses and use those instead. *Note:* * SMTP port 465 is often blocked by exit nodes, but port 587 is less frequently blocked. If you have a problem sending mail, try port *587* or configure your client to use [[Riseup's email hidden service => tor#riseups-tor-onion-services]] in place of the regular @mail.riseup.net@ domain. This is better than sending traffic through a Tor exit as it is [[MITM->security-issues#man-in-the-middle-attacks]] resistant, but it will generate certificate errors on the client side.
